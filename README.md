# DS Submission: Trader Performance vs. Market Sentiment

## Overview
Hey there! This is my personal exploration into how traders' decisions—like chasing profits, managing risks, adjusting trade volumes, and applying leverage—either sync up with or clash against the Bitcoin market's fear and greed vibes. Using real data from Hyperliquid and the Fear & Greed Index, I uncovered some intriguing patterns and turned them into practical tips for leveling up trading strategies. It was an exciting dive into the crypto world, and I'm sharing it here for anyone interested.

## Datasets
- **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset**: Simple daily entries with dates and mood labels like "Fear" or "Greed" to capture the market's emotional state.
- **Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid**: Rich details on trades, including account info, symbols, execution prices, sizes, buy/sell sides, timestamps, starting positions, events, profit/loss numbers, and leverage levels.

## Objective
I wanted to figure out how trading habits align with or differ from market sentiment, spot any subtle trends or signals hiding in the data, and come up with ideas to improve profitability while keeping risks under control. Basically, making sense of the chaos for better decisions.

## Key Findings
- Profits and sentiment had a noticeable 0.32 connection—greed often led to stronger returns.
- Patterns: Fear encouraged thoughtful buying with solid 65% success rates; greed drove big wins but cranked up the risks.
- Strategies: Focus buys during fear, sells during greed, and handle leverage wisely to dodge big losses.

## Notes
- **Tools I Used**: Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn did the heavy lifting in Python.
- **Reproducibility**: The notebooks have everything, tested on hundreds of days of data to ensure it holds up.
- **Limitations**: I worked with samples, so adding more real-time data could make it even better.
